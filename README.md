# Coderland Image Overlay routine

Given an image, this code superimposes the Coderland logo, a message, and a date
stamp on top of it. 

This repo is part of an interactive Knative and serverless tutorial called the [Compile Driver](https://developers.redhat.com/coderland/serverless/).

The Knative serverless environment lets you deploy code to Kubernetes, but no resources are consumed unless your code needs to do something. With Knative, you create a service by packaging your code as a Docker image and handing it to the system. Your code only runs when it needs to, with Knative starting and stopping instances automatically.
